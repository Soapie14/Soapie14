- 👋 Hi, I’m @Soapie14 or Sophie!
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, video games, softball, working out, and my dog! I am currently a softball coach teaching how to Pitch! I spend my free time disc golfing, working out, playing with my dog, or streaming video games like Apex Legends, Red Dead Redeption, Call of Duty, and many more!
- 🌱 My first internship was at Sports Excitement working on the front-end of their VeloSAty project. I used React.js, JavaScript, Tailwind(sometimes bootstrap), HTML, and CSS to create front-end components.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects and ideas! I love learning to code, and I want to figure out how to work together on creating all possibilities! 
- 📚 Projects I am currently working on are under Projects folder, Final projects for class are in Web Development and Python 2.0!
- 📫 How to reach me: best way is by e-mail or on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/sophieslagle
